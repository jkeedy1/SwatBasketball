# SwatBasketball
Home for all Swarthmore Basketball analysis

The goal of this repo is to do some analysis of Swat Basketball and get back into using GitHub instead of Dropbox.  

The coaches were hoping to have some PBP and +/- analysis of their games.  Hopefully can add that over a couple seasons.  Also seems like a much better place to store all the text files for the scraped PBP rather than dealing with them in Dropbox.
